# Automatic-Syntex-Generation-using-Transfer-Learning
Natural Language to SysML Code Generation Task (My master's research)


This is my master's research topic about find and implement the state-of-the art method for natural language to SysML code generation task, I've developed theTransformer-based Model with the help of transfering the knowledge of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs): BERT and  CodeBERT. I achieved the average test loss of 0.16 and the BLEU Score of 0.85 and CodeBLEU score of 0.97. 


**Requirements:**
Transformers (Hugging Face)
Pandas
Sklearn
PyTorch
import openpyxl (To read the excel dataset)

Number of Epochs: 55
Batch Size: 32

**Note:**
I've also attached my master's thesis report here, You can use it to get more deeper idea about this model and my research work.
